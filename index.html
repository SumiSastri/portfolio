          </div>
          <p> As a former Agile product-owner, I have been in tech for a while. A year ago, I made the big leap into the
            unknown to train as a full-stack developer at General Assembly.
          </p>
          <p>It was one of the best decisions of my life. There is a great satisfaction building product features,
            working in a collaborative, supportive environment and learning from senior developers.
          </p>
          <p> With one-year's experience, first as an intern at <em>goodlord</em> - a property-tech start-up, then
            freelancing with news publishers, the <em>New Statesman</em>, I looked for my first full-time job. I was
            one of 40 developers to be invited to Bletchley Park, by <em>GVC</em>, the sports gaming group, during the
            recruitment process. Our team of developers cracked the code and we won some swagger. After white-board
            tests
            and follow-up interviews, I was delighted to be one of two developers, to accept their offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have learnt so much from all the teams I have worked with, as well as continuing to level-up my skills in
            my spare time. In the last year I have learnt TypeScript, React-Hooks, React-Redux. I have had a lot of
            enjoyment during the learning process. I have showcased the application of these new skills in my GitHub
            repo.
          </p>
          <p>I am actively seeking new opportunities as a junior developer in a supportive environment where I can
            continue to contribute, learn and grow as over 100 developer roles in London are moving to India.
