            </div>
            <p>
              As a former Agile product-owner, I have been in tech for a while.
              A year ago, I made the big leap into the unknown to train as a
              full-stack developer at General Assembly.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was one of the best decisions of my life. There is a great
              satisfaction building product features, working in a
              collaborative, supportive environment and learning from senior
              developers.
            </p>
            <p>
              With one-year's experience, first as an intern at
              <em>goodlord</em> - a property-tech start-up, then freelancing
              with news publishers, the <em>New Statesman</em>, I looked for my
              first full-time job. I was one of 40 developers to be invited to
              Bletchley Park, by <em>GVC</em>, the sports gaming group, during
              the recruitment process. Our team of developers cracked the code
              and we won some swagger. After white-board tests and follow-up
              interviews, I was delighted to be one of two developers, to accept
              their offer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have learnt so much from all the teams I have worked with, as
              well as continuing to level-up my skills in my spare time. In the
              last year I have learnt TypeScript, React-Hooks, React-Redux. I
              have had a lot of enjoyment during the learning process. I have
              showcased the application of these new skills in my GitHub repo.
